<h2>Where do I live?</h2>

<h2>What are my projects?</h2>
<p>During the national lockdown, myself and others on the Media, Journalism and Publishing course worked on a news based project known as Exist News. My reason for starting Exist was to focus on my writing, design skills and communication, while working in a team, to create something respected and consistent. Applying what we learn from our course, I believe we can create something that we can all be proud of in the near future. </p></i>
