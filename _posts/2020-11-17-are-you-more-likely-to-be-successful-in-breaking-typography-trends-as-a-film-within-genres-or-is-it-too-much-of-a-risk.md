If some of the most successful films owned radically different fonts, they would not have been part of the most successful films list. The entire story, character and emotion are told through the fonts legibility to the genre. For a kid’s film to come across scary, based on its font, it would be a disaster for the promotion of the film. 

***A delicate balancing act*** 

Throughout the design process, creators and designers must try use their skills to target the audience of the genre the film is in. By achieving this they will be able to make people understand what genre it is. Should they all try to achieve the same thing There is a delicate balance between making people understand what story your film will follow and standing out from the many other films like yours. There’s certainly an argument as to whether it’s a good idea to sacrifice creativity to make sure you are accessing your target audience or to take a risk to expand your audience. To achieve both, you are probably likely to get a bonus. Typography is very emotionally sensitive to whoever is reading it, if you take your creativity too far with them, the story, emotion and character you are trying to convey may come across the wrong way.  

 

Comedy is a great example of how this works. Comedy fonts usually come across as playful and light-hearted due to their simple design. They use a big and bold design to put it in your face and grab your attention for it. They use simplistic designs to such as arial and Helvetica to show that this comedy is just about ordinary people usually, nothing fancy. This appeals to a lot more people as everyone can relate to the story as the stories is usually in a normal environment and time.  The Helvetica and the simple background we commonly see in comedies are to make it simple and easy to read, it creates little potential for friction and because of this doesn’t lead the audience to believe the comedy is actually a part of one of the comedies sub-genres.

Examples – American pie 

Shaun of the dead 

The campaign

 

A genre which makes its typography choices even more valuable is horror. The styles of horror font are usually edged and rough to never make you feel like there is any form of comfort in the film. The fonts are designed to make you feel uneasy, they usually have a irregular layout of their font to make you feel like nothing is normal in this film, giving you a sense of fearing the unknown. 

 

Examples – sinister, nightmare on elm street, saw

The last genre I will explore that expresses why it is good to follow genre trends is romance. The weight of the font is usually light to create more of a feminine feel to the film, unless it’s a romantic comedy. The fonts used are usually associated with romantic handwriting. 

 

Now can you imagine breaking these trends for the genres, would you watch the films? Would you recognise the film? There are lots of reasoning as to why typography trends exist, they are tried, tested and produce significant economic advantages, taking the risk of swaying from this, is too much economically for a production company.
